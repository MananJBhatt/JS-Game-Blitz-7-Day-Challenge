# JS Game Blitz: 7-Day Challenge

Welcome to my **JS Game Blitz: 7-Day Challenge**! This repository is a collection of JavaScript games I developed to revise and practice various JavaScript concepts. Over the course of seven days, I'll be working on a new game each day, providing an engaging way to strengthen my coding skills.

## Overview

In this challenge, I’m building and playing through seven different JavaScript games, each designed to focus on different aspects of the language. This challenge serves as both a learning exercise and a way to showcase my JavaScript skills.

## Day 1: Rock Paper Scissors 

The first game I’ve developed is the classic **Rock Paper Scissors**. This game helps me practice JavaScript fundamentals such as event handling, randomization, and DOM manipulation.

### Features

- **Player vs. Computer**: I can play against the computer with options for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks wins, losses, and draws using local storage.
- **Sounds and Animations**: The game includes sound effects and animations to enhance the user experience.

## Day 2: Memory Game

Today, I developed a Memory Game, also known as Concentration, where the goal is to find matching pairs of cards. This game builds on my JavaScript skills, focusing on array manipulation, event handling, and DOM updates.

### Features
- **Player vs. Game:** The game is played against the computer where the player needs to match pairs of cards.
- **Score Tracking:** Tracks the number of matched pairs and displays a win message when all pairs are found.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the game grid and elements are responsive across different devices.
- **Card Flip Animation:** Includes flip animations for a smooth and engaging user experience.
