# JS Game Blitz: 7-Day Challenge

Welcome to my **JS Game Blitz: 7-Day Challenge**! This repository is a collection of JavaScript games I developed to revise and practice various JavaScript concepts. Over the course of seven days, I'll be working on a new game each day, providing an engaging way to strengthen my coding skills.

## Overview

In this challenge, I’m building and playing through seven different JavaScript games, each designed to focus on different aspects of the language. This challenge serves as both a learning exercise and a way to showcase my JavaScript skills.

## Day 1: Rock Paper Scissors

The first game I’ve developed is the classic **Rock Paper Scissors**. This game helps me practice JavaScript fundamentals such as event handling, randomization, and DOM manipulation.

### Features

- **Player vs. Computer**: I can play against the computer with options for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks wins, losses, and draws using local storage.
- **Sounds and Animations**: The game includes sound effects and animations to enhance the user experience.
