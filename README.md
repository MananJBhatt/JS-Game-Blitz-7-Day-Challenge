# JS Game Blitz: 7-Day Challenge

Welcome to my **JS Game Blitz: 7-Day Challenge**! This repository is a collection of JavaScript games I developed to revise and practice various JavaScript concepts. Over the course of seven days, I'll be working on a new game each day, providing an engaging way to strengthen my coding skills.

## Overview

In this challenge, I’m building and playing through seven different JavaScript games, each designed to focus on different aspects of the language. This challenge serves as both a learning exercise and a way to showcase my JavaScript skills.
